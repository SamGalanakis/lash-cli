# E2E Scenario: Quickstart Walkthrough — Docs-Accuracy Gate

> **Read [../RULES.md](../RULES.md) first** — operator surface, poll-don't-sleep, stop
> triggers, and reporting/RCA conventions. This runbook only adds the scenario-specific
> parts.

**Purpose.** Turn every claim the Lash repository's `docs/quickstart.html` makes about
**visible behavior** into a gate against the real artifact, so the page can't drift away
from what the code does. A mismatch is a **docs bug — report it, do not fix** (do not edit
the page or the code to make the walkthrough pass).

## Pre-flight scope note (read before scoring)

The Lash repository's `docs/quickstart.html` is the **embedding** quickstart — its cover
source is `crates/lash` · `crates/lash-provider-openai`, and its "steps" are Rust API calls (add crates, build a
`LashCore`, open a session, run one turn, print the settled prose), **not** `lash`-binary
keystrokes. There is no CLI walkthrough on the page to type into the operator. So this
runbook gates the page in the two forms its claims actually take:

- **Structural / API claims** (crate names, the code snippet, the API surface) →
  machine-verified evidence in the Lash repository: docs lint must pass and the checked-in
  quickstart snippet must compile against the façade API pinned by this workspace.
- **The one runtime visible-behavior claim** ("run one turn; read the settled assistant
  message", `println!("{prose}")`) → reproduced against the real `lash` binary through the
  operator: one turn in → one settled assistant message out.

**Report the framing itself as a finding:** a literal keystroke-by-keystroke CLI walkthrough
of `quickstart.html` is not possible because the page targets the library surface, not the
operator surface. That is a scope clarification to record, not a page defect.

## Scenario-specific golden rules

1. **Every visible claim is a gate.** No claim gets a pass on trust — each maps to
   `lint_docs`, a Cargo.toml value, or a rendered operator outcome.
2. **A mismatch is reported, never fixed.** If a crate name, the snippet, or
   the one-turn behavior diverges from the page, RCA it and stop — do not reconcile by
   editing docs or code.
3. **Don't over-claim the analogue.** The operator round-trip stands in for the compiled
   program's "one turn → one settled message" behavior; it is not a line-by-line execution
   of the Rust snippet. Say so.

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight

Per [../RULES.md](../RULES.md). In a Lash repository checkout, read
`docs/quickstart.html` and enumerate its checkable claims. Confirm `scripts/lint_docs.py`
and `Cargo.toml` exist there; confirm the operator exists in this repository.

## Phase 1 — Structural / API claims (machine-verified, objective)

| # | Page claim | Gate | Expected |
|---|-----------|------|----------|
| 1 | Crate is published as `lash-runtime`; the Rust import stays `use lash::...` | Lash repository `Cargo.toml` alias | `lash = { package = "lash-runtime", … }` |
| 2 | The "Minimal Example" code (`standard_builder → provider → model(from_token_limits) → effect_host(InlineEffectHost) → attachment_store(InMemoryAttachmentStore) → build`; `core.session(..).open()`; `session.turn(TurnInput::text(..)).run()`; `result.assistant_message()`) | In the Lash repository, `python3 scripts/lint_docs.py` (the page's `data-snippet="quickstart#hello-lash"` is diffed against `examples/docs-snippets/src/quickstart.rs`) and the snippet crate's compile check against the pinned façade | `docs lint: ok`; snippet compiles against the pinned façade API |

Run `python3 scripts/lint_docs.py` in the Lash repository — a clean `docs lint: ok` is the
objective gate that the snippet and page structure haven't drifted from the compiled
snippet source. Then run the snippet crate's documented compile check at the Lash revision
pinned by this workspace. **Any divergence here is a docs bug → report/RCA, don't fix.**

## Phase 2 — The one runtime visible-behavior claim (real binary, drivable)

The page's only user-visible **runtime** claim is: run **one** turn, then read the **settled
assistant message** (`let prose = result.assistant_message()…; println!("{prose}")`). Drive
its analogue against the real `lash` binary through the operator — one turn in, one settled
assistant message out:

```
scripts/lash-operator.py --provider test
```
```
expect 20 Message · / for commands
type hello from pty
key enter
expect 25 test-provider echo: hello from pty
lash-exit 10
```

Gate: a single submitted turn produces exactly one settled assistant message
(`■ test-provider echo: hello from pty`), matching the page's "run one turn → read the
settled prose" contract. (The deterministic provider stands in for the page's OpenRouter
model; the observable shape — one turn, one settled message — is the claim under test, not
the specific words.) If a single turn produced no settled message, or more than one, the
page's central visible-behavior claim is wrong → report/RCA (do not fix).

## Phase 3 — Score

| Item | Objective gate | Verdict | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Crate-name / import claim | Lash repository `Cargo.toml` `package = "lash-runtime"` |  |  |
| Snippet / API surface un-drifted | Lash repository `scripts/lint_docs.py` → `docs lint: ok`; quickstart snippet compiles against the pinned façade API |  |  |
| One-turn settled-message behavior | one turn → one `■` settled message |  |  |
| Scope framing recorded | page is a library quickstart, not a CLI walkthrough |  |  |

**Aggregate:** do the page's structural claims match the code (crate name and
snippet), does the real binary honor its one runtime claim (one turn → one settled message),
and is the library-vs-CLI scope of the page reported rather than papered over. Any concrete
divergence is surfaced as a docs bug, never edited away.
