//! Per-tool projectors.
//!
//! Each module in this directory implements [`ToolProjector`] for one or
//! more related tool names. The dispatcher in `activity::ActivityState`
//! looks up a projector by tool name on every tool call and delegates
//! block construction. A `GenericProjector` catches any name that
//! doesn't have a dedicated projector.
//!
//! This is layer 1 of the two-layer render pipeline — see
//! [`crate::activity::projector`] for the trait definition and the
//! shape of the rendering boundary.
